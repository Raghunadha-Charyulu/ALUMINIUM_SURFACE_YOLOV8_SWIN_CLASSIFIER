## 🔍 Introduction

Surface defects like cracks, dents, and discoloration in aluminum parts are critical quality concerns in the manufacturing industry. Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate the detection and classification of such defects using an intelligent AI pipeline that combines both speed and accuracy.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The project involves two stages:

- **Defect Detection**: YOLOv8 is used to localize surface defects in input images.
- **Defect Classification**: Detected regions are cropped and passed to a Swin Transformer-based classifier to determine the specific defect type (`crack`, `dent`, `discoloration`, or `others`).

The pipeline also uses **Grad-CAM** to visualize attention maps, offering interpretability in the classification phase.

🔧 Pipeline Description
YOLOv8 Detection
YOLOv8 is used to detect and localize surface defects in aluminum images. It outputs bounding boxes that surround the defective regions within an image.

Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction
Using the detected bounding boxes, the system crops out defect-specific regions (ROIs) from the full image. These cropped patches focus only on the area of concern, improving classification performance.

Swin Transformer Classification
The extracted ROI images are passed through a Swin Transformer classifier, which leverages self-attention mechanisms and hierarchical structure to identify the defect type (e.g., crack, dent, discoloration, or other).

Grad-CAM Visualization
Grad-CAM is applied to highlight the regions within the ROI that influenced the classifier’s decision. This provides visual interpretability and trust in model predictions.

Output & Evaluation
The system returns annotated images, predicted defect classes, and visual heatmaps. It also includes classification metrics and confusion matrices to evaluate performance.

This architecture ensures a high degree of accuracy in detection, fine-grained classification, and interpretability—making it suitable for quality control pipelines in manufacturing.

📦 Technologies, Setup & Results
🚀 Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov8-swin-defect-classifier.git
cd yolov8-swin-defect-classifier
🧪 Install Dependencies (Colab/Local)
pip install ultralytics torch torchvision matplotlib

⚙️ Technologies Used
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) – For fast and accurate detection of defects using object detection architecture.

Swin Transformer (Vision Transformer) – For classifying detected defect regions into types such as crack, dent, discoloration, and others.

PyTorch – Backbone framework for building and training the Swin Transformer model.

Torchvision – For loading pre-trained vision models and applying image transformations.

Matplotlib – For visualizing the Grad-CAM outputs and result overlays.

Grad-CAM – For generating heatmaps to visualize the influential areas during classification.

Scikit-learn – For calculating performance metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.

Google Colab – Used as the development and training environment with GPU acceleration.

📈 Results
The model was trained and evaluated on an aluminum surface defect dataset. Here are the performance metrics achieved by the Swin Transformer classifier on a test subset:

Defect Type	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Crack	0.91	0.88	0.89
Dent	0.85	0.90	0.87
Discoloration	0.88	0.85	0.86
Others	0.83	0.82	0.82

🔍 These metrics reflect model performance on 1000 test samples. Actual results may vary based on dataset quality, image resolution, and further fine-tuning.

The results demonstrate the pipeline’s robustness in not only detecting defects accurately with YOLOv8 but also classifying them effectively using Swin Transformer with interpretable Grad-CAM visualizations.
