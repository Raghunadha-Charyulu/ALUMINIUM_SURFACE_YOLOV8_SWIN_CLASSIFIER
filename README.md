## üìå Overview

The presence of surface defects in aluminum components affects the structural integrity and usability in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction. Manual inspection is slow and error-prone. This project automates the detection and classification process using a two-stage deep learning approach:

- **YOLOv8** for localized detection using oriented bounding boxes.
- **Swin Transformer** for classifying the defect type.
- **Grad-CAM** to visualize important features driving the prediction.
- **Evaluation metrics** to validate model performance.

### üîç Description

- **Input Image**: Raw aluminum surface image from dataset.
- **YOLOv8 Detection**: Detects and localizes defect regions using oriented bounding boxes.
- **Cropped Regions**: The defect-specific regions are cropped for classification.
- **Swin Transformer**: Classifies each region into categories like crack, dent, discoloration, or others.
- **Grad-CAM**: Generates visual explanations for model predictions.
